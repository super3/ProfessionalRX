		I was introduced to Mark via Professional Rx through a mutual friend. Prior to meeting Mark I never thought about using a career or professional coach. My initial thought was that I was smart and savvy enough to continue my career search on my own and that a career or professional coach would not add any value to my search for a new career.  After my initial session with Mark it was very clear that he was a highly skilled professional with years of experience.  Subsequent to our initial conversation Mark did a great assessment of both me and more core skill set.  Mark was able to identify skills and attributes that I knew that I had, but were not on the forefront of my mind.  Mark worked closely with me to help me understand both my value in my current role, but also the value that I could bring to my next potential employed.  Mark coached me through both the job prospecting process and the interview process.  Mark’s advice on interviewing for a senior management position was invaluable. Mark’s advice was personal to me and it wasn’t filed with jargon nor was his advice that was “cookie cutter” that could be provided to another potential client.  Using the tools that Mark provided me I was able to secure a series of interviews for a senior management position that I would not have been able to secure on my own.  I highly recommend Mark and Pro Rx!
