				<h3>PERSONAL BRAND DEVELOPMENT</h3>
				Personal branding is the process of differentiating oneself from others within designated professions or spaces of recognition.  It is the conscious decisions of 
				individuals to choose and/or highlight distinguishing qualities for interacting with others. Branding certification agency Reach 360 describes personal branding as 
				the new revolution in the way professionals manage their careers or businesses, a way of clarifying and communicating what makes them unique and using those qualities
				to separate themselves from peers as a means of greatly expanding success. 
				<br/><br/>
				Similarly, Wikipedia defines personal branding as the process whereby people and their careers are marked as brands. It has been noted that while previous self-help 
				management techniques were about self-improvement, the personal branding concept suggests that success comes from self-packaging. Personal branding is the strategy 
				behind the world's most successful people. It is often the difference between an ordinary career or business and an exceptional one.
				<br/><br/>
				Clients that decide to develop personal brands will initially complete an online assessment that will be used to develop the documentation that will define and support
				personal brand development.

				<h3>PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENT REVIEW</h3>
				Choosing the proper documentation to communicate candidate qualification information is essential to effective evaluation by potential employers.  The Resume, Curriculum Vitae (CV)
				and cover letter are the most widely accepted tools for communicating candidate information. The cover letter is used to draw attention to specified qualifications of the candidate
				and introduce the resume or CV.  The decision to use a resume (and resume type) versus a CV largely depends upon the industry in which the candidate is seeking the opportunity.  
				<br/><br/>
				Resumes are the most commonly accepted tool among job seekers.  They are recognized across most industries and generally developed in one of the four formats (chronological, functional, 
				combination and targeted) listed below.  
				<br/><br/>
				The Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a longer, more detailed form of resume most commonly used in the academic, medical, legal, educational and science fields to outline experience and education.
				CV’s also list other relevant items e.g. publications, certifications, courses taught, presentations, awards and honors and professional associations of potential candidates.

				<h3>PROFESSIONAL MENTORING AND COACHING</h3>
				Pro Rx Professional Mentoring is the process of providing proficient knowledge and practical expertise about a given field as well as answers to job execution questions.
				The Pro Rx methodology uses an initial consultation to assess client needs, research industry and company information to develop branded action plans that highlight strengths. 
				Once a mentoring package is agreed upon, SMART Goals are defined, an action plan is outlined and regular review meetings are scheduled to assess progress, review findings and amend 
				the action plan. Regularly scheduling meetings, as described in the action plan, will ensure alignment and assist all parties in achieving the desired goals. In these meetings, 
				clients will have the opportunity to discuss and/or role play a range of ideas and methods before deciding a course of action. 
				<br/><br/>
				Many professionals wish to focus development on gaining wealth and professional recognition. Achieving these goals usually involved satisfying a number of requirements laid down by
				your employer or institution. Obtaining help and guidance from a senior colleague who is knowledgeable about the requirements and the level of achievement expected is generally
				helpful however; the professionals seeking guidance and insight should beware that a personal bias may exist and the risk of internal exposure within the organization is a real
				threat to success. 
				<br/><br/>
				At Pro Rx, Coaching is a 360-degree, 1:1 developmental process. There are many methods of executing professional coaching. Traditionally, the most common arrangement is for a private,
				one-on-one, 30-45 minute coaching sessions that take place via scheduled web-based meetings or telephone sessions as defined by the clients needs. Many clients choose to meet weekly 
				while others secure Pro Rx services two or three times per month. Many opt for face-to-face meetings instead of web-based or telephone sessions. The more frequent the sessions, the easier
				it is to keep the process moving forward.
				<br/><br/>
				During these sessions, your Pro Rx representative will:

				<ul>
					<li>Ask questions to make you think</li>
					<li>Help you set SMART Goals</li>
					<li>Provide clarity and focus on goals, aspirations and ambitions</li>
					<li>Challenge you to go for the gold</li>
					<li>Welcome and reinforce success</li>
				</ul>

				The objectives  of the coaching sessions are to enhance professional development and provide guidance towards obtaining the desired personal and professional goals.  The areas of focus are:

				<ul>
					<li>Situation Analysis</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Strength Assessment</li>
						<li>Personal Actualization Sessions</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Goal Setting</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Desired Outcome</li>
						<li>Timeline</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Execution Plan Development</li>
